# CRM LLM

This repo contains the logic, templates, scripts, and skill instructions for a private AI-first personal CRM built on a markdown/git vault.

The system is optimized for relationship-led advisory work, while still supporting consulting, dealmaking, and founder/investor matchmaking workflows.

The source of truth is not this repo. The source of truth is the private vault at `CRM_DATA_PATH`, typically `./crm-data/`.

## What This Repo Does

This repo gives an agent or developer the machinery to:
- create and maintain CRM records in markdown
- sync Gmail and Google Calendar into relationship memory
- enrich that ingest with meeting-note discovery from Google Drive plus optional post-ingest Granola and WhatsApp review
- mirror CRM tasks into Google Tasks with durable task IDs
- generate a relationship-first dashboard
- track leads before conversion
- process raw capture through an `Inbox/`
- assemble relationship memory from `Notes`, `Activities`, `Tasks`, and linked entities
- suggest investor/deal matches

The current canonical schema lives in `docs/schema-spec.md`.

## Application Layout

- `apps/api/`: standalone read-only FastAPI API for programmatic consumers building their own CRM clients.
- `apps/web/`: local FastAPI HTML application for the read-only dashboard MVP.
- `apps/cli/`: reserved application package for future first-class CLI UX.
- `scripts/`: current operational utilities and lower-level CRM workflow helpers.
- Web and future CLI surfaces may call the API service layer where appropriate, but web-specific routes/templates/static assets should stay out of `apps/api/` and CLI command code should stay out of `apps/web/`.

## Start Here Fast

If you are a new agent or developer and need to get productive quickly, read in this order:

1. `docs/schema-spec.md`
2. `AGENTS.md`
3. `crm-data/DASHBOARD.md`
4. `crm-data/index.md`
5. `crm-data/log.md`

Then adopt these current assumptions:
- `crm-data/` is the system of record
- `crm-daily-processing` is the preferred top-level daily workflow
- `Deal-Flow/` is still the live deal inventory directory
- `waiting` is a first-class task state and its `due-date` should usually mean the next review/check-back date
- a company may exist both as a `Deal` and as an `Opportunity`, but those records mean different things
- Workspace ingest now means: Gmail / Calendar first, then additive Drive, optional Granola, and optional WhatsApp post-passes

Use this distinction:
- `Deal`: a company / startup in inventory that can be matched to investors
- `Opportunity`: the pre-close commercial pursuit
- `Engagement`: the post-close commercial and execution container
- `Workstream`: a specific execution lane inside an engagement

## Mental Model

Think in two layers:
- `crm-llm/`: public-friendly logic layer
- `crm-data/`: private vault and operational system of record

The vault is where the real work happens. The logic layer exists to read, write, enrich, and synthesize that vault.

## Navigation Artifacts

The vault root now maintains two navigation files for agents and operators:
- `index.md`: a generated, content-oriented catalog of every CRM record grouped by entity type
- `log.md`: an append-only chronological ledger of mutation workflows such as creates, conversions, inbox processing, and ingest runs

Operating rules:
- read `index.md` first when locating relevant CRM pages
- treat `index.md` as derived state and rebuildable
- treat `log.md` as append-only operational history
- mutation workflows should update both automatically

## Current Model

The system currently uses this memory model. The key record types are:
- `Organization`: stable market entity
- `Inbox`: temporary raw capture
- `Lead`: pre-conversion relationship record
- `Contact`: person record
- `Account`: commercial relationship record
- `Opportunity`: pre-close commercial path
- `Engagement`: post-close commercially won work
- `Workstream`: execution lane within an engagement
- `Deal`: startup/inventory seeking capital
- `Source Artifact`: canonical pointer to external evidence or working documents
- `Retainer`: recurring commercial commitment under an engagement
- `Invoice`: billed obligation tied to an engagement
- `Payment`: received payment tied to an invoice
- `Note`: durable context and strategic memory
- `Activity`: real interaction or event
- `Task`: explicit next action

Important current rules:
- `Inbox/` replaces the old “notes as inbox” pattern.
- `Notes/` are durable context, not raw intake.
- If something happened, it should usually create an `Activity`.
- `Lead` is first-class and converts by default to `Organization + Contact + Account + Opportunity`.
- `Organization` owns stable identity/classification, while `Account` owns the active commercial relationship.
- Investor mandate and check-size stay on the organization side; fundraising stage and target raise stay on `Deal`.
- `commercial-value` is canonical on Opportunities; `deal-value` is compatibility-only.
- closed-won opportunities should usually hand off into an `Engagement`.
- every `Workstream` must belong to exactly one `Engagement`.
- The default home view is relationship-first, not chronology-first.
- `Deal` and `Opportunity` are intentionally separate:
  - use `Deal` for investor-shop inventory
  - use `Opportunity` for John's possible mandate with that company

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- A compatible coding agent runner
- `gws` CLI authenticated to the relevant Google Workspace account
- local `codex` CLI if you want the optional Granola post-ingest pass to run automatically
- local `wacli` if you want the optional WhatsApp post-ingest pass to run automatically

### Configure the vault path

Create `.env` in the repo root:

```text
CRM_DATA_PATH=./crm-data
```

### Initialize a fresh vault

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/init-crm-data/scripts/init-vault.py crm-data
```

### Most useful commands

Sync Workspace:

```bash
CRM_DATA_PATH=./crm-data python3 .agents/skills/crm-ingest-gws/scripts/ingest.py
```

Sync Workspace but skip the Granola post-pass:

```bash
CRM_DATA_PATH=./crm-data python3 .agents/skills/crm-ingest-gws/scripts/ingest.py --skip-granola
```

Sync Workspace but skip the WhatsApp post-pass:

```bash
CRM_DATA_PATH=./crm-data python3 .agents/skills/crm-ingest-gws/scripts/ingest.py --skip-whatsapp
```

Refresh dashboard and derived views:

```bash
CRM_DATA_PATH=./crm-data python3 .agents/skills/update-dashboard/scripts/update-dashboard.py --skip-followups --skip-commit
```

Create a lead:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/crm-lead-manager/scripts/lead_manager.py create --name "Example Lead" --status new
```

Process an Inbox item:

```bash
python3 scripts/inbox_manager.py process <item> --outputs note activity task --primary-parent-type opportunity --primary-parent "Opportunities/Example"
```

Create an Activity directly:

```bash
python3 scripts/record_manager.py create-activity --title "Intro call with Jane" --activity-type meeting --date 2026-03-15 --primary-parent-type opportunity --primary-parent "Opportunities/Example"
```

Create or review an Opportunity workflow:

```bash
python3 scripts/opportunity_manager.py review "Opportunities/Example"
```

Mark an opportunity won and create the post-close handoff:

```bash
python3 scripts/opportunity_manager.py mark-won "Opportunities/Example" --create-engagement --engagement-type advisory --commercial-model retainer --create-workstream --workstream-type research
```

Review or add post-close execution structure directly:

```bash
python3 scripts/engagement_manager.py review "Engagements/Example"
python3 scripts/engagement_manager.py create-workstream --engagement "Engagements/Example" --workstream-type research --name "Market Validation Track"
```

Create finance records for active delivery:

```bash
python3 scripts/finance_manager.py create-retainer --engagement "Engagements/Example" --amount 5000 --currency USD --cadence monthly
python3 scripts/finance_manager.py create-invoice --engagement "Engagements/Example" --workstream "Workstreams/Example" --amount 2500 --currency USD --due-date 2026-07-15
```

Create a source artifact tied to a workstream or engagement:

```bash
python3 scripts/source_artifact_manager.py create --primary-parent-type workstream --primary-parent "Workstreams/Example" --source-system google-drive --source-type doc --url "https://docs.google.com/..."
```

Rebuild the CRM index manually:

```bash
python3 scripts/navigation_manager.py rebuild-index
```

Create an Account linked to an Organization:

```bash
python3 scripts/account_manager.py create --organization "Organizations/Example-Capital" --relationship-stage prospect --strategic-importance medium
```

Create a Contact linked to an Account:

```bash
python3 scripts/contact_manager.py create --name "Jane Doe" --account "Accounts/Example-Capital" --email "jane@example.com"
```

Create a Deal in the live `Deal-Flow/` inventory:

```bash
python3 scripts/deal_manager.py create --name "Example Startup" --fundraising-stage "Series A" --coverage-status active
```

Create or update a Task with the live status model:

```bash
python3 scripts/task_manager.py create --name "Follow up with Jane" --due-date 2026-04-10 --primary-parent-type opportunity --primary-parent "Opportunities/Example"
python3 scripts/task_manager.py set-status "Tasks/2026/04/2026-04-10-follow-up-with-jane.md" --status waiting --review-date 2026-04-13
python3 scripts/task_manager.py set-status "Tasks/2026/04/2026-04-10-follow-up-with-jane.md" --status completed
```

Sync CRM tasks to Google Tasks:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/crm-sync-google-tasks/scripts/sync-tasks.py
```

Run the local CRM web dashboard:

```bash
uv sync
CRM_DATA_PATH=./crm-data uv run uvicorn apps.web.crm_frontend.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

The web dashboard lives under `apps/web/` and is read-only in the MVP. It live-reads `Leads/`, `Opportunities/`, and linked CRM context from `CRM_DATA_PATH`; it does not mutate markdown records, `index.md`, or `log.md`.

Run the standalone read-only CRM API:

```bash
CRM_DATA_PATH=./crm-data uv run uvicorn apps.api.crm_api.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001 --reload
```

The API exposes JSON endpoints such as `/pipeline` and `/records/{item_key}` for custom clients.

## Day-To-Day Operating Loop

For a new operator or agent, the normal loop is now best treated as the top-level skill `crm-daily-processing`.

That workflow should:
- run Workspace ingest
- review staged suggestions
- ask the user for off-system updates from WhatsApp, in-person meetings, calls, and other uncaptured channels
- reconcile `todo`, `waiting`, and stale tasks
- review live opportunities, engagements, workstreams, and leads
- refresh the dashboard and derived views

At a lower level, the manual sequence is:

1. Run Workspace sync.
2. Review `crm-data/staging/activity_updates.json`.
3. Review `crm-data/staging/contact_discoveries.json` and `crm-data/staging/lead_decisions.json`.
4. Review `crm-data/staging/opportunity_suggestions.json` and `crm-data/staging/task_suggestions.json`.
5. Review `crm-data/staging/drive_document_updates.json` and `crm-data/staging/granola_updates.json` when present.
6. Process or create `Inbox/` items into durable records.
7. Create or update `Leads`, `Activities`, `Notes`, `Tasks`, `Engagements`, `Workstreams`, and finance records as needed.
8. Run the dashboard refresh.

If you only do one thing to get oriented in a live vault, read:
- `crm-data/DASHBOARD.md`
- `crm-data/INTELLIGENCE.md`
- `crm-data/RELATIONSHIP_MEMORY.md`
- `crm-data/index.md`

## Workspace Sync Behavior

Workspace sync now has two important guarantees:
- it always tries to read the underlying Gmail body or Calendar event details before creating a durable Activity
- it persists a sync checkpoint in `crm-data/staging/workspace_sync_state.json`

That means:
- repeated sync runs resume from the last successful Gmail/Calendar checkpoint by default
- `source-ref` is still used as a second dedupe layer
- passing `--since YYYY-MM-DD` overrides the saved checkpoint for backfills

Current ingest behavior is broader than just Gmail / Calendar:
- Gmail messages are processed with thread-aware task detection and can use prior thread context plus attachment metadata
- calendar and email events still do broad meeting-note lookup first
- a later additive Drive pass can ingest CRM-labeled Google Docs that were updated since the sync window
- a later optional Granola pass can create deduped Activities and Tasks from recent meetings if local Codex + Granola MCP are configured
- a later optional WhatsApp pass can stage CRM-relevant chat signals from local `wacli` history if enabled in settings

Codex desktop operational note:
- `gws` needs live Google API network access; restricted sandbox runs can fail before Gmail / Calendar ingest starts with DNS or host-resolution errors.
- For the recurring CRM daily automation, use the approved unrestricted command form:

```bash
/bin/zsh -lc 'set -a; [ -f .env ] && . ./.env; set +a; CRM_DATA_PATH=${CRM_DATA_PATH:-./crm-data} python3 .agents/skills/crm-ingest-gws/scripts/ingest.py --autonomous --auto-tier 1'
```

- If a sandboxed attempt hits a Google API network error, rerun that command with escalation before treating Workspace ingest as blocked.

Current staging / audit files you should expect from ingest:
- `crm-data/staging/activity_updates.json`
- `crm-data/staging/contact_discoveries.json`
- `crm-data/staging/lead_decisions.json`
- `crm-data/staging/opportunity_suggestions.json`
- `crm-data/staging/task_suggestions.json`
- `crm-data/staging/drive_document_updates.json`
- `crm-data/staging/granola_updates.json`
- `crm-data/staging/whatsapp_updates.json`
- `crm-data/staging/ingestion_audit.json`
- `crm-data/staging/workspace_sync_state.json`

Useful ingest settings in `crm-data/settings.json`:
- `crm_drive_label_ids`
- `granola_post_ingest_enabled`
- `granola_post_ingest_lookback_days`
- `whatsapp_post_ingest_enabled`
- `whatsapp_post_ingest_lookback_days`
- `whatsapp_account`
- `whatsapp_store_dir`

## Optional Granola Setup

Granola is not required for baseline CRM operation. If you want the automatic post-ingest Granola pass, configure Granola MCP in local Codex first:

```bash
codex mcp add granola --url https://mcp.granola.ai/mcp
codex mcp login granola
codex mcp list
```

Practical notes:
- the current implementation calls Granola through local `codex exec`
- if Codex or Granola MCP is unavailable, ingest should still complete normally
- Granola-derived records preserve durable provenance in `source` / `source-ref` so future runs can dedupe correctly

## Optional WhatsApp Setup

WhatsApp is not required for baseline CRM operation. If you want the automatic post-ingest WhatsApp pass:

- install and authenticate `wacli`
- enable it in `crm-data/settings.json` with `whatsapp_post_ingest_enabled`
- optionally set:
  - `whatsapp_post_ingest_lookback_days`
  - `whatsapp_sync_max_db_size` (default `500MB`; safety ceiling for the SQLite archive)
  - `whatsapp_archive_max_messages` (default `5000`; retains the newest X messages after CRM processing, or `0` to disable pruning)
  - `whatsapp_account`
  - `whatsapp_store_dir`

Practical notes:
- the current implementation first runs a bounded `wacli sync --once`, then reads the local SQLite archive in read-only mode
- sync failures caused by missing authentication, connectivity, or a held store lock are recorded in `whatsapp_updates.json`; the pass fails open and reads any existing archive it can access
- on the first WhatsApp run without a saved checkpoint, ingest scans the full local `wacli` history instead of only a short recent window
- after checkpointing begins, the SQLite rowid is the durable cursor so messages added late after a sync outage are not excluded by older WhatsApp timestamps
- after CRM processing succeeds, rolling retention keeps only the newest `whatsapp_archive_max_messages` rows by WhatsApp timestamp; pruning results are recorded in staging
- if `wacli` is unavailable or its store cannot be read, ingest should still complete normally
- WhatsApp results are staged in `crm-data/staging/whatsapp_updates.json`
- the current policy is intentionally conservative: unanchored WhatsApp groups are ignored by default, and unanchored direct chats require strong business signal before staging anything
- for direct chats, ingest now also allows conservative exact-name soft matching against a unique CRM Contact or Lead and uses recent thread context to interpret short acknowledgements

## Naming Conventions

Use `YYYY-MM-DD` dates everywhere.

Current filename conventions:
- all CRM record filenames use hyphen-separated slugs; do not use spaces or punctuation in record filenames
- new `Activities`: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- new generated `Tasks`: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- `Activities/`, `Tasks/`, and `Notes/` are bucketed under `YYYY/MM/`

Legacy files may still exist in older filename shapes. Do not assume the whole vault is perfectly migrated.

## Important Operational Rules

- Always resolve `CRM_DATA_PATH` dynamically from `.env` or the environment.
- Always use the templates in `templates/` for new records.
- Treat `index.md` as generated state; rebuild it rather than editing it manually.
- Treat `log.md` as append-only; do not rewrite old entries.
- All wikilinks in YAML frontmatter must be quoted, for example:
  - `account: "[[Example Account]]"`
- Prefer updating existing linked records over creating duplicates.
- For Gmail and Calendar ingestion, do not create meaningful records from subject lines alone.
- `crm-data` may be a nested git repo or ignored locally. Check before assuming normal git behavior.

Current execution rules:
- `todo`: you owe the next move
- `waiting`: someone else owes the next move
- `completed`: done or clearly superseded
- when moving a task to `waiting`, update `due-date` to the next review date
- task records may also persist `google-task-id` and `google-task-list-id` when linked to Google Tasks
- for company fundraising work, decide explicitly whether you are recording a `Deal`, an `Opportunity`, or both

Google Tasks operating rule:
- the CRM remains the source of truth for task creation and structure
- `crm-sync-google-tasks` mirrors CRM-created tasks into Google Tasks and may pull remote completion back into the CRM
- do not assume Google-native personal tasks belong in the CRM unless an explicit intake workflow is added later

Preferred current write surface:
- use the manager CLIs for `Organization`, `Account`, `Contact`, `Deal`, `Task`, `Lead`, `Opportunity`, `Engagement`, finance, and source-artifact lifecycle work
- use `record_manager.py` for first-class `Activity` and `Note` creation
- use `inbox_manager.py` for raw capture processing

## Current Rough Edges

Be aware of these realities:
- the vault contains a mix of current-shape and older records
- the vault still uses `Deal-Flow/` as the live deal directory
- some legacy Activities and Tasks still use older frontmatter shapes
- some compatibility fields are still tolerated by readers during migration cleanup
- not every workflow auto-commits vault changes
- GitHub MCP auth may be unreliable in this environment; `gh` CLI may be the fallback

If you are new to the project, start with the dashboard, inspect one relationship end to end, then run Workspace sync and review staged proposals before making broader changes.

## Agent Navigation Pattern

When working inside a live vault:
1. Read `index.md` at the vault root to find candidate records.
2. Drill into the linked pages you actually need.
3. Let mutation workflows append to `log.md`.
4. Use `log.md` to understand what changed recently and which workflows have already run.
